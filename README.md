Seaborn models I like:
“Multiple linear regression”
![Multiple linear regression](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/multiple_regression.html)
-THINK color=genre; line=economic feature; dots = genre consumption
(evaluating impact of each economic feature): can we remove any?
 
"Lineplot from a wide-form dataset"
![Lineplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/wide_data_lineplot.html)
- THINK: x=time; line1= genre consumption; line2=Economic feature (NOTE: Layered scales will be needed on y-axis)
 

“Plotting model residuals”
![Plotting model residuals](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/residplot.html)
- THINK: x=time; line=Economic feature; dot = genres (each genre is a different color)
