# Intersection of Economic Change & Media Genre Selection
Do economic changes affect the genre(s) of media that are consumed?
-----

As economic change occurs, what genres of media do we choose? When you're financially stressed, do you maintain the same habits in your media selections? Or do you lean on self-help, finance, or comedy media? 

We hypothesize that: **Economic change DOES impact the genre of medias consumed**

-----
## Project Design 

### Preliminary questions: 
- How can "economic change" be defined? Are some indicators better than others? 
- What types of media should be considered? Can different types of media be viewed in aggregate, or should they be individually weighted?
- What data sources will be useful?
- How can this question be computationally answered?

### Why is this topic relevant?
This question evaluates consumer preferences against the state of the economy. This type of exercise is valuable for marketing strategies for any industry, and is a worthwhile analysis to time product releases. 

We selected this topic because it intersects several areas of interest among our group members, including e-commerce, finance, and reading.

## Team Notes

### Roles

△ Maria-Gabriela: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

◯ Phil: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

X  Matt: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.

□  Emily: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.
