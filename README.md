# Intersection of Economic Change & Media Genre Selection
Do economic changes affect the genres of media that are consumed?
-----

As economic change occurs, what genres of media do we choose? When you're laid off, do you maintain the same habits in your media selections? Or do you lean on self-help, finance, or comedy media? For this project, we hypothesize that: 
** Economic change DOES impact the genre of medias consumed**

Preliminary questions: 
- How can "economic change" be defined?
- What types of media should be considered? Can different types of media genre results they be viewed in aggregate?
- What data sources will be useful?
- How can this question be computationally answered?

- Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
- Link to dashboard (or link to video of dashboard demonstration)
- Link to Google Slides presentation
