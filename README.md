## Raw Economic Data
# Sources
Historical unemployement - bureau of labor statistics
Inflation (Urban CPI) - bureau of labor statistics
Equity Indices: S&P, Dow Jones: yahoo finance 
Home Buyers' Index : fhfa.gov - federal housing finance agency
University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment: FRED (federal reserve economic data)

## Issues with the data
- Some is quarterly, some monthly
- History goes back for different time periods
- Some in excel charts in 2 dimensions, some as csv lists...
- cpi needs to be turned into inflation numbers (divide by period)

## going forward
- review with the group, decide on scope, time period, adequacy
- bring data into consistent formats
