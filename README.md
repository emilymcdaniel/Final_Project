# Intersection of Economic Change & Media Genre Selection
Do economic changes affect the genre(s) of media that are consumed?
-----

As economic change occurs, what genres of media do we choose? When you're financially stressed, do you maintain the same habits in your media selections? Or do you lean on self-help, finance, or comedy media? 

We hypothesize that: **Economic change DOES impact the genre of medias consumed**

## Project Design 

### Preliminary questions:

- What types of media should be considered? Can different types of media genre results they be viewed in aggregate?
- What data sources will be useful?
- How can this question be computationally answered?
